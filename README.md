## **Requirements**

- Python 3.7+
- beautifulsoup4==4.13.4
- requests==2.32.4
- plyer==2.1.0 
- lxml==6.0.0 
- fake-useragent==2.2.0
- schedule==1.2.2
- PySocks==1.7.1

## 🛠️ **Installation**

### **1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Igor-Kaminski/Scraper/tree/main
cd ebay-price-monitor
```

### **2. Create virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
# or: venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

### **3. Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **4. Configure your products**
Edit `config.py` to add your products to monitor:
```python
# Multi-product configuration
PRODUCTS = [
    {
        'name': 'retimax 1500',                    # Display name for notifications and logs
        'keywords': ['retimax 1500'],              # Search terms for eBay
        'my_price': 100,                          # Your selling price
        'delivery_cost': 0,                       # Your delivery cost
        'enabled': True                           # Enable/disable this product
    }
    # Add more products here...
]

# Scheduler settings
SCHEDULER = False  # False = run once, True = run as daemon
CHECK_INTERVAL = 3600  # How often to check (seconds) 

# Notification settings
NOTIFICATION_TITLE = '🚨 Price Alert!'
NOTIFICATION_MESSAGE = '{count} competitors cheaper than you!'
NOTIFICATION_TIMEOUT = 10
```

## 🎮 **Usage**

### **Run Once (Default)**
```bash
python main.py
```
- Checks prices once and exits
- Perfect for cron jobs or manual runs

### **Run as Daemon**
1. Set `SCHEDULER = True` in `config.py`
2. Run `python main.py`
3. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop gracefully

```bash
python main.py
# Output: Starting daemon mode - checking every 3600 seconds
# Press Ctrl+C to stop
```

### **What Happens**
1. **Checks each enabled product** in your PRODUCTS list
2. **Searches eBay** using the first keyword for each product
3. **Parses all listings** and extracts prices
4. **Compares to your price** and identifies cheaper competitors
5. **Shows product-specific notifications** if competition is found
6. **Logs everything** to `logs/scraper.log`
7. **Saves full links of cheaper listings** to `logs/scraper_links.log`
8. **Repeats** every hour (if daemon mode enabled)

## ⏱️ **Automation**

### **Option 1: Built-in Daemon (Recommended)**
Enable the built-in daemon mode for continuous monitoring:

1. Set `SCHEDULER = True` in `config.py`
2. Run `python main.py`
3. The daemon runs continuously until stopped with `Ctrl+C`

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **No external setup** - works out of the box
- ✅ **Easy to start/stop** - just run the script
- ✅ **Configurable timing** - adjust `CHECK_INTERVAL` as needed
- ✅ **Graceful shutdown** - handles `Ctrl+C` properly

### **Option 2: External Schedulers**

#### **Linux / macOS (Cron)**
```bash
crontab -e
# Add the following line to run every hour
0 * * * * /full/path/to/.venv/bin/python /full/path/to/main.py >> /full/path/to/logs/cron.log 2>&1
```

#### **Windows (Task Scheduler)**
1. Open **Task Scheduler** → **Create Task**
2. Set **Trigger** → **Daily** → **Repeat task every 1 hour**
3. Set **Action** → **Start a program** → **Program**: `python.exe`, **Arguments**: `main.py`

**Notes:**
- Use external schedulers only if you prefer `SCHEDULER = False`
- Replace `/full/path/to/` with the absolute path to your project
- External schedulers work with one-time runs only

## ⚙️ **Configuration**

### **Product Settings**
Each product in the `PRODUCTS` array has these settings:
- `name`: Display name shown in notifications and logs
- `keywords`: List of search terms (uses first one for eBay search)
- `my_price`: Your selling price for this product
- `delivery_cost`: Your delivery cost (set to 0 for free shipping)
- `enabled`: `True` to monitor, `False` to skip this product

### **Scheduler Settings**
- `SCHEDULER`: Run mode - `False` for one-time, `True` for daemon
- `CHECK_INTERVAL`: How often to check prices (seconds) 

### **Notification Settings**
- `NOTIFICATION_TITLE`: Title of the desktop alert
- `NOTIFICATION_MESSAGE`: Message text (use `{count}` for number of cheaper listings)
- `NOTIFICATION_TIMEOUT`: How long the notification stays visible (in seconds)

### **Links Logging**
- Full URLs of cheaper listings are written to `logs/scraper_links.log`
- Console output stays clean (no full URLs), only titles and prices



## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

- **Respect eBay's terms of service**
- **Don't make requests too frequently**

### **Notifications not working?**
- Ensure `plyer` is installed
- Check your desktop notification settings
- Try running with sudo (Linux permission issues)

### **Getting blocked by eBay?**
